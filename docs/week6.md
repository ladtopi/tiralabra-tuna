# Report for week 6

This week I cleaned up the top end of the application a bit more, added some
tests, and expanded the documentation. I think the technical parts of the
project are now more or less ready.

Next week will be spent on polishing the documentation, as well as double
checking the tests are suitably representative.

Hours used: ~5h (course total 51h).
